what was added

added a diffuse and abump texure this was added to the map and the path way, apllied texures to them and increaded the bumpsness to show a dirt path and gravel surrrdoing it
this allows me to added a normal texure and a bump texure to the marterial and allows me to change the bum level with a silder
reason for adding this was to give the map a more texured look like its rock the player is walking on 

added moving water etexure. it has foam layer, bump map, speed, freq, amp. This will allow me to added the normal water texure
then a foram layer to give it more of a water feel, after im able to change the speed, freq and amp to the awater to either make it 
more clam, or create crazy waves. reason for adding it was to make it look like acutal water that around the map 

Color corrcetion. this allows me to apply a color table to the snece that will change the mood of the game so i added a table that hads 
draker tones and muted colors. Reason for adding it was to give the map of darker tone like this is the final area of the dreaded 
bowers.
